# Twilio Environment Builder

With the purpose of making it easier to spin up new Twilio environments, especially those that use Flex, this Pulumi script takes a newly created account (although it will also work with accounts that are already in use) and take many manual steps out of the user's hands, like setting up sample queues, preparing Whatsapp for Flex use and deploying some of the most used plugins.

## Flex Plugins Installed
* Whatsapp Media Messages
* Whatsapp Outbound Messages
* Chat Tasks Transfers
* Flex Localization

## Console Setup Steps Executed
* Two Sample Queues (Support and Sales)
* Messaging Service for Flex
* Whatsapp Flex Flow
* Flex Plugins Functions and Needed Setup
* Event Streams Sink (optional)
 

# Setup

## Requirements

Before starting setup, make sure you have the tools below installed:

1. [Twilio CLI](https://www.twilio.com/docs/twilio-cli/quickstart)
2. [Twilio Infra Plugin](https://github.com/kaiquelupo/plugin-twilio-infra)
3. [Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/reference/cli/)
4. The following Information regarging the account:

| Name      | Description |
| --------  | ----------- |
| Account SID | SID of your newly created account |
| Auth Token | Authentication Token of your newly created account |
| Whatsapp Number | Whatsapp Number to be used on Flex. **IMPORTANT:** For a new account you are not going to have this info, as Whatsapp onboarding takes some time. In that case, you can use the [Sandbox](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/sms/try-it-out/whatsapp-learn) number for testing and replace it for the actual number later
| Streams Endpoint | Endpoint for your **Event Streams** Sink. Leave it blank if you don't wish to use it

## Deployment

1. Log into your new account, providing the info Twilio CLI asks for


    `twilio login`

2. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/gabeoliveira/twilio-poc-pulumi.git`
3. Navigate into the project folder
4. Run `source setup.sh [name of your project]` (It creates the Twilio Infra project, clones submodules and setup the Pulumi script within the project. If you wish to know exactly which commands it runs, check [here](https://github.com/gabeoliveira/twilio-poc-pulumi/blob/main/setup.sh))
5. Setup your environment variables with the Twilio Account information gathered above
6. Run `twilio infra:deploy` (**IMPORTANT:** During the Preview step, Pulumi will say that resources related to TaskRouter couldn't be found. That's normal, as we don't have access to the Workspace SID yet)
7. Because the API doesn't allow to add Whatsapp numbers to Messaging Services. That step needs to be done manually. Go to the recently created [service](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/sms/services) and add your Whatsapp number. If you're using **Sandbox**, copy the Webhook endpoint in the Messaging Service and paste it in the "When a message comes in" box in the [Sandbox Settings](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/sms/settings/whatsapp-sandbox)

**OBSERVATION:** During the first deploy, some Flex Plugins might raise a conflict error. It will happen if you have other Twilio Projects that run the same Plugin and are using the same terminal as the other project. This is because of a environment conflict. If it happens, just deploy the project again.


# Modifying your Project

The main advantage of using an Infrastructure as Code approach is that you can change things on your script without having to worry about conflicts and maintenance. This script contains sample queues and workflows so you can setup yours by just modifying or creating new queues directly on the script.

If you need to add new resources (SIP Trunks, new services, new Functions, etc), please follow the [Twilio Pulumi Provider](https://github.com/kaiquelupo/twilio-pulumi-provider-example) example. Please note that this provider is not officially supported by Twilio.
